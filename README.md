# ClothesWear-context
A responsive and modern clothing wear website built with React.js. This project was created as a practice platform to improve my understanding of core React concepts including components, state management, props, hooks, and routing.

 Features
 Product Listings – Showcases a variety of clothing items.

 Filtering – Filter products by category (e.g., Men, Women, Accessories).

 Product Details Page – View more information on each item.

 Add to Cart – Users can add products to their shopping cart.


What I Practiced with React
 Creating reusable components (Product, cart, cartModal)

 Passing and handling props

 Managing global state (using useContext or Redux if applied)

 Conditional rendering

 Organizing components into folders (e.g., /components, /pages)
